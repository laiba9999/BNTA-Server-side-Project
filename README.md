# BNTA - Server-Side Project (Moop City)

This is a team project that was undertaken during the BNTA Bootcamp where we had to create a backend application
with an MVP of allowing users to make `GET` and `Post` requests.
<br/>
Our application utilises the tech stacks Java, Spring and PostgreSQL to allows users to store information using CRUD operations.
We had dependencies such as Flyway for version control of our database along with JDBC API so that we can connect and access the database.
We used Hikari datasource as the connection pool mechanism as it is lightweight and better performing.
<br/>
During the project, we came accross some challenges such as getting errors when creating the database and tables along with some 
connectivity issues between our Java classes which we managed to debug using online resources such as StackOverflow.

### Planning

Before diving into the coding, we spent the first day on planning. 
We handled time-management by creating a Kanban Board using Trello which helped us create and assign tasks to each member. We assigned different tasks to allow for individual, in-pair and group work.
<br/>
<br/>
We created models for our relational database to help structure the information and data into a set of tables. We created links between each table to determine the different relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, etc. This helped us visualise our database before creating it.
<br/>
<br/>
We had a discussion about the possible classes that we would need including their fields, data type, and methods. Then modelled it using the website Miro.
<br/>
<br/>
Once this was all planned out and agreed upon, we created this repository to allow us to start programming.

### How to install

  - To install the backend application, press the green `Code` button in this GitHub repository and select the option <br/> `Download Zip`. 
  - Once downloaded, use an unzipper application to unzip the files.

### How to use

Setup 
<br/>
Software you will need:
  - Intelij IDE
  - PostgreSQL
  - Java SE17
1. Open up Intelij and open the directory you downloaded using the open button in intelij.
2. Use the PostgreSQL application to initialise and start up the database.
3. Run the program using intelij.
Note: A more detailed version of how to set up will be on the Wiki of this repository.
